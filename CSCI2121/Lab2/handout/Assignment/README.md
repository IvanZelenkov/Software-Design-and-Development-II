You are given a complete java program (Look at the attached file). The goal of the assignment is to comment the code properly. You won't be making any changes to the code itself. You have 4 files to comment:   
* Movable.java     
* MovableCircle.java    
* MovablePoint.java
* MovableRectangle.java

You can ignore the TestApp.java.

You will be graded as:
* 40 points - All files and well commented
* 30 points - All files but not poorly commented
* 20 points - Partially commented
* 10 points - Partially commented and poor comments

**Gitlab**
