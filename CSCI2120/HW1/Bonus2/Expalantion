Questions Bonus 2:
1)Can code duplication be reduced by using inheritance and having a common abstract superclass and/or interface?

In my project, I have created three java classes. The first is the abstract class ComplexNumber,
the second is the concrete class RealNumber and the third is the JUnit class, which tests all possible
numbers. Duplication of code, in this case, can be reduced by the fact that I have created an abstract
class, that is, the concept of a complex number and the concrete class must complement it.

2) What is the relationship between an imaginary number and a real number?

The relationship between a real number and an imaginary number, I wrote this way: a class Real number
is a real number and an imaginary number, which can be written as a real number multiplied by the
imaginary unit i.

3) Implement and test this...

My tests passed 4 out of 4.
