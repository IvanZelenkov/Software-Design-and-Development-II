Question Bonus 3:
If you made ComplexNumber a supertype to RealNumber in Bonus 2,
above, while this makes perfect sense within the context of
ease-of-programming, and an inheritance hierarchy, are there
any drawbacks to doing it this way, from a practical perspective?

In this solution, which I used according to Bonus 2, I believe that
in this case for this problem the real number is a complex number and
it is not correct to derive the real number from the complex,
because it violates the Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP), which
says that the derived class is not should hide the properties of
the base class. Subclasses should override base class methods so that
functionality is not broken from the client's point of view. I implemented
this in my code. In the case of this assignment, it makes no sense
to implement the real as a complex number, where the imaginary part is
set to zero. This is exactly the case when inheritance confuses us,
while the inheritance of interfaces would be good here, the inheritance
of implementation would lead to incorrect and illiterate design.
