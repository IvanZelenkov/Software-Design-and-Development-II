###Description
I provided an implementation of a text-based adventure game. 
Currently, the game responds to directional movements that allow
you to move your adventurer around a maze. I added the ability
to save (and load) the game using object serialization. I wrote
the serialization of the file out to a custom filename which you 
can choose. Remember, you can use only .dat extension for the filename.

###Instructions
1. Open Java files and save them on your computer in one directory.
2. Open Terminal (Mac OS) or Command Line (Windows).
3. Type cd command `cd` and the name of the directory 
until you reach the directory(Bonus) where you will see .java files.
4. Compile the code by the command `javac *.java`
5. Once youâ€™ve compiled the code, you can run the game by typing in your shell:
   `cat d1.txt - | java AdventureGame`
6. The 'Adventure Game' has a map on which located 3 enemies and you as a hero.
You need to get a key to escape the maze. You have 4 buttons to move the hero and 
3 to control the activity of the game.

`w` - go up.

`a` - go left.

`s` - go down.

`d` - go right.

`save` - save the game(You should enter the name of the file where you want to get the save).

`load` - load the game(You should enter the name of the file where you want to load the game).

`quit` - quit the game.
