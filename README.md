# Software-Design-and-Development-II
This course is an introductory course in Computer Science with an emphasis on programming in a high-level, object- oriented language. This supporting language is Java. The course is centered on the design and implementation of simple objects, and employs an iterative specify/design/implement/test strategy. This project includes all the work that I did during my second semester in Java language, i.e. Software-Design-and-Development-II.
